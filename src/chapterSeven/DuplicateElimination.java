//7.12 (Duplicate Elimination) Use a one-dimensional array to solve the following problem:
//        Write an application that inputs ten numbers, each between 10 and 100, both inclusive.
//        Save each number that was read in an array that was initialized to a value of -1 for all elements.
//        Assume a value of -1 indicates an array element is empty.
//        You are then to process the array, and remove duplicate elements from the array containing the numbers you input.
//        Display the contents of the array to demonstrate that the duplicate input values were actually removed.
//        [Note: do not display the array elements where the value is -1]
